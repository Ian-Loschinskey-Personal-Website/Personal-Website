                As an avid reader of manga, I have always been drawn to the unique art style, 
            complex storylines, and rich characters that this medium offers. Whether it's action-packed shonen series, heartwarming slice-of-life tales, or gripping psychological dramas,
             I am always eager to explore new titles and immerse myself in different worlds.
              I find that reading manga not only offers a source of entertainment but also a way to broaden my perspectives and gain insights into different cultures and ways of life. In my free time, you can often find me curled up with a good manga book, eagerly turning each page to see what happens next.

                Being a learning developer and gamer, I have always been fascinated by the parallels between the two worlds. Just like in gaming, programming requires a strategic and creative mindset to solve complex problems and overcome obstacles. 
                Whether it's debugging code or navigating a challenging level, both require patience, perseverance, and the ability to think critically. 
                Additionally, the constantly evolving landscape of technology and the gaming industry means that both developers and gamers must stay up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques to stay ahead of the game. 
                As someone who loves gaming and developing/coding , I find these similarities between the two fields to be both rewarding and exciting.

                I who is deeply interested in anime and Japanese culture. 
                Ever since I was introduced to anime, I've been fascinated by the unique art style, storytelling, and characters that make this medium so compelling. 
                I enjoy immersing myself in the vibrant and colorful world of anime, from the action-packed shonen series to the heartwarming slice-of-life stories.

        <h1 id="about-h1-m2" style="display: none;">Although I have shared three facts about myself, there are other productive activities and daily routines that I engage in regularly. I also enjoy hanging out and connecting with friends by going to the movies, visiting the mall, and eating out. I have a particular fondness for food, especially seafood or cuisine.
